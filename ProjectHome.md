This project holds C functions for graph-based image processing using the **Image Foresting Transform** (IFT) `[`1`]`. Those functions are able to perform 2D multiscale skeletonization, boundary and region based image segmentation, supervised pattern classification, and other operators.

Please download the file **[ift-demo-v2.tar.gz](http://ift-demo.googlecode.com/files/ift-demo-v2.tar.gz)** to obtain the stable release of these functions and look into the _ift-demo/demo_ folder for example programs.

The implementation of the algorithms are following the lectures of the
SP-ASC 2010 in [www.ic.unicamp.br/~afalcao/talks](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~afalcao/talks.html).

Enjoy and do not hesitate in contacting us with doubts, suggestions, or if you need one of the papers related to the demo programs, which are cited at the beginning of the source files.
